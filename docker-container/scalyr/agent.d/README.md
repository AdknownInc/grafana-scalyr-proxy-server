# Scalyr Config With Docker

Following the instructions on Scalyr's help page [here](https://www.scalyr.com/help/install-agent-docker) says to make an api_key.json file to supply your api keys to the scalyr container.

There is an api_key.example.json file, remove the .example part from the name and insert your own api_key into the file. It will be ignored with the .gitignore.
